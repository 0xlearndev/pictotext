Privacy of Women in George Orwell's 1984 and the TV Episode Fifteen Million Merits

Abstract

Privacy and surveillance are two major concerns that are discussed heavily in both
1984 by George Orwell as well as in the TV series, Black Mirror, The constant monitoring
and the dominion seemed rather terrorizing to Orwell writing his masterpiece over seventy
years ago. In todayâ€™s world, however, as it is depicted in Black Mirror albeit in a more
futuristic aspect, shows how being under the gaze of so many apparatuses perpetually
throughout the day, does not seem to bother the citizens at all. This article will discuss how
this violation of privacy affects the lives of the protagonists on a daily basis and in general.
Moreover, this article pays specific attention to the treatment of the main female characters in
both 1984 and Block Mirror and will observe how different they are dealt with compared to
their male counterparts. It will be then concluded that women are in more ways than one
treated stereotypically the same in both of the cases in hand though Black Mirror being

created much later than the other one.
